      <header>Introduction</header>
      <p>As many of you have noticed, I often use this image of a doodled face with a gigantic crown perched atop its head, connected by a tube-shaped forehead. Its sarcastic smile has undoubtedly caught the attention of many viewers, but some of you might be wondering: What is this? </p>
      <p>So the 17 year old me decided to give an answer to this question in my beginner front end project in my programming journey.</p>
      <code>Fun fact: This is a basic front-end project I coded for freecodecamp.org in my first year. The guideline requires me to use code blocks in my writing, although I don't need any.</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="Background">
      <header>Background</header>
      <p>You might be wondering if I actually drew this piece or if it has some deeper meaning behind it. </p>
      <p>Acutally, no.</p>
      <p>This artwork originated from a random player I encountered in Draw Me when I was in 13 years old, a classic game where players draw a given word while others guess it. </p></p>
      <code>(Unfortunately, I believe this specific game has been shut down, though plenty of similar ones still exist.)</code>
      <p>Given the word “Crown,” this player quickly depicts this straightforward, vivid yellow crown, which most participants guessed correctly. But then, they proceed to add on a bizarrely shaped head beneath the crown. The unexpected quirky addition made it unforgettable to me.</p>
      <p>Amused by this masterpiece created within a mere 60 seconds, I took a screenshot, laughing at its brilliance. Little did I know that this image would become a symbol representing me across the internet for years to come.</p>
      <code>Crowngie, Crowngy, Crownie, whichever feels right, I never really decided a offical name for it.</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="Usage">
      <header>Usage</header>
      <p>Many of you may notice that I've using this a lot in my social media platforms, including: </p>
      <li>Wechat</li>
      <li>Instagram</li>
      <li>Discord</li>
      <li>Pixiv</li>
      <li>Twitter (X)</li>
      <li>LinkedIn (I changed it probably because I became a boring adult)</li>
      <code>Yes, this is my first choice of profile picture everytime I register a new account. And as you can see this project require me to create a list.</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Why">
      <header>Why</header>
      <p>The question I hear most often is: Why? If it has no meaning, why choose this? I would say the the choice behind it is both simple and complicated.</p>
      <p>The lightly satirical looking of this creature or thing feels like a match for my personality, and the process of its creation fascinates me. The face wasn’t needed to exist; it had no connection to the original topic. Yet, instead of the crown belonging to the head, the head seems to belong to the crown. This unintentional twist gives the piece an oddly profound charm. For me, this simple, rough creation brings more thoughts and feelings more than it was ever intended to carry.</p>
      <p>You might think I’m overanalyzing—but that’s the point. Art is a mirror, revealing to each of us a meaning shaped by our own experiences and perspective.</p>
      <code>Crowngy sounds kind of like Cringe, maybe that was a unconcious move.</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Conclusion">
      <header>Conclusion</header>
      <p>Over the years, Crowngie has evolved far beyond just a profile picture on my social media—it has become my personal mascot. I’ve created countless variations of Crowngie, including holiday-themed editions, animated GIFs, and even a live 2D model. Thanks to a thoughtful friend who gifted me a 40cm Crowngie plush pillow, I now even own Crowngie merch! This quirky character has truly become a cornerstone of my online and offline presence.</p>
      <p>At the very end, I appeciate the time you wasted on reading this. We shared a moment of interspace connection when you are reading this and when I was writing this.</p>
      <code>I don't know what to put on this html/css project. I should've just generate some random text rather than wasting a few hours to write this. </code>
