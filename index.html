    <p>Crowngie is virtual, but it truly exists in your imagination.</p>

    <p>Look at its smiling face. Meet its gaze.</p>
    <p>Do you ever wonder — is it alive?</p>
    <p>Does it blink?</p>
    <p>What kind of sound does it make?</p>

    <p>It could have the texture of ceramic, or be as fragile as an eggshell.</p>
    <p>Is the true form inside the crown, or lies beneath the face?</p>
    <p>What does it look like the head below?</p>

    <hr>

    <p>When you think about everything related to Crowngie, it truly begins to exist in your subconsciousness.</p>
    <p>From then on, it quietly hides away, only to suddenly reappear the next time you think of it.</p>
    <p>Each time you see Crowngie again, it might look a little different.</p>
    <p>That's normal — everything changes. You might have changed too.</p>
    <p>Even so, you can still imagine it as if you are meeting it for the first time.</p>

    <p>
        But one day, Crowngie will disappear forever, and you won’t know when that moment happened.
    </p>
    
    <p>That day will be the last time you ever think of Crowngie.</p>

    <p>So treat every meeting as if it were the last.</p>

    <p>Every time you think of Crowngie again, remember to say goodbye！</p>
