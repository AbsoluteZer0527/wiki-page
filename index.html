      <p>As many of you have noticed, I often use this image of a doodled face with a gigantic crown perched atop its head, connected by a tube-shaped forehead. Its sarcastic smile has undoubtedly caught the attention of many viewers, but some of you might be wondering: What is this? Why am I using it? And what's the purpose behind it?</p>
      <p>In this webpage, I’ll take you behind the scenes of this image, sharing its origin, significance, and a few hints as to why it resonates with me so deeply.</p>
      <code>Fun fact: this front-end project requires me to use code blocks in my writing, although I don't need any. Anyway I will use them as comments to add more details in my text.</code>

      <p>You might be wondering if I actually drew this piece or if it symbolizes some important characters. Surprisingly, this artwork originated from a random player I encountered in Draw Me when I was in 7th grade (around 7 years ago), a classic game where players draw a given word while others guess it. </p>
      <code>(Unfortunately, I believe this specific game has been shut down, though plenty of similar ones still exist.)</code>
      <p>Given the word “Crown,” this player started with a straightforward, vivid yellow crown, which most participants guessed correctly. But then, they took it to the next level by adding a bizarrely shaped head beneath the crown. This unexpected addition, with its quirky charm, elevated the drawing into something unforgettable.</p>
      <p>Amused by this masterpiece created within a mere 60 seconds, I took a screenshot, laughing at its brilliance. Little did I know that this image would become a symbol representing me across the internet for years to come.</p>

      <header>Usage</header>
      <p>Many of you may notice that I've using Crowngy a lot in my social media platforms, including: </p>
      <li>Wechat</li>
      <li>Discord</li>
      <li>LinkedIn(now changed into a more professional one)</li>
      <li>Pixiv</li>
      <li>Twitter(X)</li></p>
      <code>Yes, this is my first choice of pfp everytime I register a new account.</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="Why">
      <header>Why</header>
      <p>What I hear most often about this piece is: Why? What does it mean to you? I would say the story behind it is both simple and complicated.</p>
      <p>The silliness of "Crowngy" feels like a perfect match for my personality, and the story of its creation resonates deeply with me. The face wasn’t meant to exist; it had no connection to the original topic. Yet, instead of the crown belonging to the head, the head seems to belong to the crown. This unintentional twist gives the piece an oddly profound charm.For me, this simple, rough creation holds so much meaning—perhaps more than it was ever intended to carry. </p>
      <code>Ironically, the original artist might not even remember making it.</code>
      <p>At this point, you might think I’m overanalyzing this shit, that I should get a life instead. But that brings me to the deeper point I want to share—art is like a mirror. It reflects back to each viewer a unique meaning, shaped by their own perspective and experiences.</p>

      <header>Conclusion</header>
      <p>Over the years, Crowngy has evolved far beyond just a profile picture on my social media—it has become my personal mascot. I’ve created countless variations of Crowngy, including holiday-themed editions, animated GIFs, and even a live 2D model. Thanks to a thoughtful friend who gifted me a 40cm Crowngy plush pillow, I now even own Crowngy merch! This quirky character has truly become a cornerstone of my online and offline presence.</p>
      <code>I used CHATGPT to stylize the shit I wrote so it sounded more utterly disturbing.</code>
      <p>At the very end, thank you for reading through this whole bullshit because I don't know what to put on this html/css project. I should've just generate random text rather than wasting a hour to write this. </p>
